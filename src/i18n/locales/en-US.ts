    jobDescriptions: {
      metaDescription: `At Meta, I work within Kustomer, a platform that allows businesses to manage all their communication channels in one place. Here, I develop applications and provide feedback on UX to improve the platform. 

      Currently, I am working on a design system that will be open-sourced, enabling external developers to develop standardized applications that align with our brand. 
      
      This makes our application review process easier, provides a better, faster and more consistent development experience, and offers a more consistent application experience for end-users.`,

      kustomerDescription: `The same as Meta description, but the company was bought and is no longer part of the conglomerate. I still work on the same project.`,

      xteamDescription: `X-Team works with big, innovative brands like Coinbase, Riot Games, Fox Broadcasting, Twitter, Sony, Intel, Beachbody, Kaplan Inc., and more.

      At X-Team, I work for a fintech company in California called Groundswell, developing a donation platform for businesses and employees. My focus is on the main application, which is built using React Native. 
      
      I aim to help people and promote a culture of robust testing to ensure that anyone can safely refactor our code. As a financial platform, we have implemented various security standards, such as SOC2. I am currently working on a complete platform rewrite, which involves switching from GO to Node.JS stack.`,
      zeDeliveryDescription: `Zé Delivery is Brazil's largest beverage delivery app, with millions of users, powered by Anheuser-Busch InBev.

      In this role, I contributed to the development of a better user experience in the main application as part of the Consumer Purchase team, focusing on improving user price perception and conversion.
      
      During this time, I reduced technical debt by refactoring the "browse" feature, which accounted for about 1/3 of the application, significantly decreasing development delivery time.
      
      I also developed a robust implementation for handling deep links, boosting our marketing campaigns, and assisted in creating Mozeic, our design system that is currently under construction.
      
      Additionally, I interviewed potential team members and created a new API for our Code Challenge using Node.js.`,
      alfredDeliveryDescription: ` Alfred Delivery is a delivery app focused on more miniature cities and remote areas in Brazil. It currently has franchises in over 90 cities.

      I was responsible for maintaining and adding minor features to our production app in Ionic 3. After a few months, I got to rewrite the app in React Native, entirely revamping the interface while drastically improving performance.`,
      microImportGroupDescription: `Micro Import is a Premium Apple Service Provider in Brazil, inside the state of São Paulo - The best and first one in the region.

      While there, I got to go from an authorized technician to a developer in 2017. As a first development-focused job, it was under my umbrella, making from ground-up WordPress templates for all companies in the group and internal management software.`,
